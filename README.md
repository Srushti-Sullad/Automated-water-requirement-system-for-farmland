# Automated-water-requirement-system-for-farmland

<>Project Overview
The Automated Water Requirement System for Farmland is an IoT-based smart irrigation solution designed to enhance agricultural efficiency and conserve water resources. This system continuously monitors real-time environmental factors such as soil moisture, humidity, and temperature using sensors. Based on the data collected, it automatically decides whether irrigation is necessary, thus reducing manual effort and preventing overwatering or underwatering of crops.

<>Key Components
Arduino Uno – Acts as the central microcontroller.
Soil Moisture Sensor – Measures the moisture content in the soil.
DHT11 Sensor – Captures surrounding temperature and humidity.
Relay Module – Controls the water pump based on sensor data.
Water Pump – Supplies water to the farmland.
Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266) – Enables remote monitoring and control via the internet.

<>Features
Automatically irrigates when soil moisture is below the threshold.
Displays live temperature and humidity data.
Manual pump control available via IoT dashboard.
Helps conserve water by preventing unnecessary irrigation.
Can be monitored and controlled remotely using a mobile or web app.

<>Real-Time Use Case
This system is especially beneficial for farmers who:
Have limited water resources.
Want to automate irrigation for better time management.
Live far from their agricultural land and need remote control capabilities.
Aim to adopt precision agriculture techniques.
